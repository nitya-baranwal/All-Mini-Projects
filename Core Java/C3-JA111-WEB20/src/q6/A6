Answer:

Upcasting:

During the Runtime polymorphism process, in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime
rather than compile-time.
In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a
superclass. The method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as
upcasting.

The above explanation has been explained with an appropriate code example with super(or parent) class 'Animal
and sub(or child class) 'Dog'.
