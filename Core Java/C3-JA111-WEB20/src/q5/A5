Answer:

As we know that to a parent class variable we can assign the child class object also,
and from that parent class variable if we try to call any overridden method then due to
Runtime polymorphism the overridden method will be called.

If a parent class reference points to a child class object, with that parent class reference we can not call
the child class specific methods, which are not available inside the parent class.

"To call the child class specific method from the parent class reference variable, we need
to downcast the parent class variable to the appropriate child class object."

We can downcast the parent class variable to the child class object only if the Parent class
variable points to the Child class object , otherwise it will throw a runtime exception
called ClassCastException.


The above explanation has been explained with an appropriate code example with super (or parent) class 'Animal'
 and sub (or child) class 'Dog'.
