Q.4
a. What are the benefits of using an abstract method?
b. Explain with an appropriate code example.


Answer :

When we require just method declaration in super-classes, this can be achieved
by specifying the abstract type modifier.
They have no implementation specified in the super-class. Thus, a subclass
must override them to provide method definition. To declare an abstract method, use this general
form:

      abstract type method-name(parameter-list);

As we can see, no method body is present. Any concrete class(i.e. class without
abstract keyword) that extends an abstract class must override all the abstract methods
of the class.
The sub(or child) class which extends the abstract class and overrides the abstract method may contain
concrete methods but it is absolutely necessary to override the abstract method of the super(or parent) class.

This has been explained with an appropriate code example in class "A4" with child class "ChildOfA4".
