Q.3
What is the significance of using the final keyword with the following programming
constructs.
a. variable
b. method
c. class


Answer:

The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be
used in many context. Final can be:
1. variable: If we make any variable final, we cannot change the value of a final variable(It will be
             constant).
             In Java, the final variable must be initialized before we use it, either at the time of
             declaration or inside the constructor of the class.
2. method: If we make any method final, we cannot override it inside the child class.
3. class: If we make any class as final, we cannot extend it. final class does not have the child
          class.
