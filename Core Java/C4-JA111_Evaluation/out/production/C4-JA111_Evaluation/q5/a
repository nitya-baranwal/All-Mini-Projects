a.When should you use LinkedList over ArrayList?


Answer:

        LinkedList should be used where modifications to a collection are frequent like addition/deletion operations.
        LinkedList is much faster as compared to ArrayList in such cases.
        In case of read-only collections or collections which are rarely modified, ArrayList is suitable.
