c. What is the difference between final and finally. Write the code for the same.

  Answer:
        Following points are the main differences between "final" and "finally":

        1.  Final is a "Keyword" and "access modifier" in Java.
            whereas Finally is a "block" in Java.
        2.Applicability: Final is a keyword applicable to classes, variables and methods.
            Finally is a block that is always associated with try and catch block.
        3.Working: (1)  Final variable becomes constant, and it can't be reassigned.

                                   e.g. final int FILE_OPEN = 2;


                   (2)   A final method can't be overridden by the child class.

                                   e.g. class A {
                                        final void method() {
                                        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
                                        }
                                        }
                                        class B extends A {
                                        void method() {         //Clas B can not inherit the method of class A.
                                        System.out.println("Does not override");
                                        }
                                        }



                   (3) Final Class can not be extended.

                                   e.g. final class A {
                                               A(){
                                                    System.out.println("This is a final class");
                                               }
                                        }
                                        class B extends A { // Class B can not inherit class A
                                               B(){
                                                    System.out.println("Final class cannot be inherited");
                                               }
                                        }

                   whereas
                   A "finally" block, clean up the resources used in "try" block.


                       e.g. class FinallyExample {
                            // This method throw an exception out of the method.
                            static void NewClass() {
                                try {
                                    System.out.println("inside NewClass");
                                    throw new RuntimeException("demo");
                                } finally {
                                    System.out.println("NewClass's finally");
                                }
                            }


        4.Execution: Final method is executed upon its call.
                    whereas
                    "Finally" block executes just after the execution of"try-catch" block.
