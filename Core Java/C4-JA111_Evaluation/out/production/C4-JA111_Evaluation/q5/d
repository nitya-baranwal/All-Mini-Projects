d.What is the difference between throw and throws. Write the code
  for the same.

  Answer:
          Following points are the main differences between "throw" and "throws":

          1."Throw" is a keyword which is used to throw an exception
            explicitly in the program inside a function or inside a block of code.

                    e.g.public class DemoThrow{
                           public void checkAge(int age){
                              if(age<18)
                                 throw new ArithmeticException("Not Eligible for voting");
                              else
                                 System.out.println("Eligible for voting");
                           }
                           public static void main(String args[]){
                              DemoThrow obj = new DemoThrow();
                              obj.checkAge(13);
                              System.out.println("End Of Program");
                           }
                        }
            whereas
            "Throws" is a keyword used in the method signature used to declare
            an exception which might get thrown by the function while executing the code.

                    e.g.public class ThrowsClass{
                           public int division(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException{
                              int t = a/b;
                              return t;
                           }
                           public static void main(String args[]){
                              ThrowsClass obj = new ThrowsClass();
                              try{
                                 System.out.println(obj.division(15,0));
                              }
                              catch(ArithmeticException e){
                                 System.out.println("You shouldn't divide number by zero");
                              }
                           }
                        }

          2.With "throw" keyword we can propagate only unchecked exception
            i.e checked exception cannot be propagated using throw.
            whereas
            On other hand, "throws" keyword handles both checked and unchecked exceptions.
