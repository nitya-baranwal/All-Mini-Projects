1. Explain the four pillars of object-oriented programming.

Answer: The fours pillars of OOP are:

        1. Encapsulation: Like in capsule, we can keep variables, data and methods together inside a class.

        2. Abstraction :  It is used to hide method inside class, and only allowing user to use its functionality.

        3. Inheritance : This is used to inherit properties of a class by another class.

        4. Polymorphism: The same method can have different behaviour for different classes.
