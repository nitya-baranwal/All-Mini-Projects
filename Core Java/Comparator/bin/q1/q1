Q1/ What is the Difference between Comparable and Comparator? Explain with examples.


Comparable is meant for objects with natural ordering which means the object itself must know how it is to be ordered. 
For example Roll Numbers of students. Whereas, Comparator interface sorting is done through a separate class.
Logically, Comparable interface compares “this” reference with the object specified and Comparator in Java compares two different class objects provided.
If any class implements Comparable interface in Java then collection of that object either List or Array can be sorted automatically by using Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() method and objects will be sorted based on there natural order defined by CompareTo method.
A basic differentiating feature is that using comparable we can use only one comparison. Whereas, we can write more than one custom comparators as you want for a given type, all using different interpretations of what sorting means. Like in the comparable example we could just sort by only one attribute,
 i.e., year but in the comparator, we were able to use different attributes like rating, name, and year as well.
