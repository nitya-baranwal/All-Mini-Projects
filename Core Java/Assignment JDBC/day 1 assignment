Q1/- What is the requirement of Java Database communication?


A1/-


RDBMS are excellent in data storage in a secure and easily retrieval manner, but it is very
poor in processing and presenting the data in user-understandable format.

Java is excellent in processing the data and presenting the data, but poor in storing the data
(In Java, we can store the business data permanently using Serialization and Files).

So, in order to develop a powerful business application, we need to
communicate our Java Application with the DB server.



Q2/- What is JDBC, Write a note on JDBC driver software.


A/-

--Java App can do any task only through the method calls and objects, 
these method calls and object are not directly understandable to the DB s/w.

--DB s/w can understands only sql, Java Compiler does not accept the sql syntax directly.

--Inspite of hetergenious platform Java-DB communication is possible through the JDBC.

Java -------- Jdbc driver s/w -----------------DB s/w



JDBC is a technology that enables any kind of Java application to communicate with any kind of DB s/w in a standard manner.


Jdbc technology is given by Sun-microsystem(Oracle Corp)


JDBC technology comes in the form of a specification (It is a documentation which describes rules and guidelines to develop a perticular s/w : "jdbc driver s/w").


--JDBC driver s/w is the implementation of the JDBC specification, which will act as a translator s/w to communicate Java App with the DB s/w.

--Each DB s/w have their own JDBC driver s/w, so DB vendor will implement the 
JDBC specification and they develop the JDBC driver s/w.

--these driver s/w comes in the form of a .jar file.


Mysql:   mysql-connector.jar

Oracle : ojdbc6.jar

Postgres : postgress.jar

--all the jdbc driver s/w is developed according the the same JDBC specification.

nityaDB:         Java Developer 

driver for nityaDB: 

nityadb.jar 

MyClass.getconn()
submit(sql)
getData() 

--if we develop the ratandb.jar (driver s/w according to the JDBC specification)
then any Java developer can communicate with the our DB s/w in a standard manner.


JDBC driver:
==========

--it is a translation s/w written in Java according to the Jdbc Specification
(it comes in the form of .jar file)

Responsibility of Jdbc Driver :
=======================

1. establishing the connection.

2. receiving the jdbc method calls (java method call) and translate them
into the DB understandable format (sql) and forward them to the DB server.

3. Translating the DB s/w given result in the the Java format (Java objects) and returns that object to the JDBC client.




Q3/- Write a Jdbc application to establish the connection with the Mysql database.

Java Application {

classes 
methods 
interface 

}

--compile all the .java files -----> .class files ----> zip all the .class files inside a .jar file


ratanapp {
A.java
B.java
Demo.java
} // after compilation and creating a jar files (a1.jar)



class X{ // here we need to set a1.jar file in the classpath of our application 
	// then only the jar file related classes will available inside this class
main(){
A a1= new A();


}

}



--in order to communicate our Java application with the DB server, Java
developer need to get/download Jdbc driver s/w and need to add the jdbc driver related 
jar file in the classpath of our application.



--In order to communicate our java appplication with the DB server, Java Developer needs 2 things:

1.JDBC driver related jar file

2.jdbc API (this api comes in the form of following 2 packages):

1.java.sql
2.javax.sql

--this JDBC API contains all the library classes, interfaces using which we can communicate our java application with the DB server.

Note: Jdbc API comes along with the JDK installation.


Q4/- Write down the responsibilities of the Jdbc Client.

JDBC client:
==========

--In Java DB communication, our Java application will act as a client becoz Java application needs the services of DB server. so our Java app is a Jdbc client.


Responsibility of the JDBC client:
===========================

1. Reqesting the DB connection.

2. Submitting the appropriate SQL statement to the DB server in the form of String object.

3. Processing the result given by the DB server.

4. Dealing with exceptions if any.

5. Manging the transactions whenever it is required.

6. closing the connection once done with the DB operation.
