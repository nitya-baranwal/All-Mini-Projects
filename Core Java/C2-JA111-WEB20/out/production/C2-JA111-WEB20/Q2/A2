2.What do you understand by “Java Strings are immutable”.
  Explain the advantages and disadvantages of immutability of
  Strings.

Answer:
        Strings are immutable because if we change string value of one reference variable,
        it will change for all the other reference variables pointing to the same reference.
        For example, let us suppose ther are 3 variables which refer to same string value "Nitya",
        If one reference variable changes the value in the reference, it will get changed for the other reference variables.
        That is why String objects are immutable in java.

        Advantages of immutability:
        1. It provides more security than to lose data.
        2. Immutable strings are cheap to copy, because it can directly copy a reference or pointer to the data.

        Disadvantage of immutability:
        1. This cause to consume lot of memory by creating different object for distinct strings.
